| Drink champagne | Drink Champagne |
| Those are someone else's dreams | Lean and look, left and right |
| For years and years I chased their cheers | Run in place |
| Stop | Stop |
| From now on... | Side steps | 
| It starts tonight... and when the promise | Shake hands and be buddy buddy |
| From now on... | Get back in starting position (2 in back, 3 in front) |
| Chorus: and we will come back home | Up Down Up Down (4 times) |
| Chorus: Home again | Hands up |
| Chorus: and we will come back home | Run in place (4 times) |
| Chorus: Home again | Hands up |
| Chorus: and we will ... | Jumping Jacks |
| Chorus: Home again | Hands up |
| Chorus: and we will ... | Big Claps |
| Chorus: Home again | Hands up |
| Chorus: and we will ... (x3) | Robin solo, groomsmen kneel down |
| These eyes will not be blinded by the light | Prepare to get into line formation |
| What's waited until tomorrow starts tonight | Right left right left, then Robin walks through to the front |
| From now on | Back to starting position |
| Chorus: and we will ... | Slap left leg |
| Quiet: and we will | Groomsmen pause |
