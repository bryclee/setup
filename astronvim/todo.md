- [x] Add <c-f> mapping
- [ ] See if there are different options for neotree filter behavior
  - Would prefer not to filter into folders by default when using `/`
  - Would prefer fuzzy finder to accept filter on Enter instead of selecting the file
- [ ] Set norelativenumber
- [ ] Can I use FZF syntax/search instead of telescope?
  - Search by file as well as name
  - Used to the FZF seach syntax, seems to be more flexible
- [ ] Set `wildoptions`
- [ ] Mapping to drop into file explorer from the current file (previously '-')
- Hide bufferline, only want to show tabs
  - Mixed, this might be useful to keep. Buffers are tagged to the tabs they were spawned in, which is interesting for keeping track
  - If you close the tab, the buffers do stay open, but they don't show up in the bufferline of the other tabs
- [ ] Surround plugin?
- [ ] Align the neotree split mappings to the telescope/fzf ones
- [ ] Add neorg
- [ ] GraphQL language server doesn't seem to be working
