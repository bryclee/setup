# Chromebook specific setup

- [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/)
- Install [Secure Shell App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en), offers slightly better terminal experience
    - Afterwards, import the [backup settings](./chromebook/Secure\ Shell\ Preferences\ Backup.json) which already has the color scheme setup
- [Solarized color theme](https://github.com/jarlg/solarized-crosh)
