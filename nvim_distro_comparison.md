## LazyVim

### Pros

- Has GBrowse mapping through snacks.nvim
- Has better integration with extra plugins through LazyExtras 
- The mappings are more intuitive to me

### Cons

- Has seemingly more bloat to disable (cmd preview, flash search, search and replace plugin)
- Has rootdir behavior
- Has a fair amount of custom plugins (eg. `noice`) which are hard to configure if you don't like the default behavior

### Customizations

See [todo](./lazyvim/todo.md)

## AstroNvim

### Pros

- Search autoclears on change
- Several easy setups for plugins available through `astrocommunity`

### Cons

- More opinionated. Maybe good or bad. Example, split on `|` is nice until you realize you can't quickly go to column.

### Customizations

See [todo](./astronvim/todo.md)
